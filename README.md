This is my remade version of an old project I did in 2018. I loved the idea of the project, but looking back at it, the code just wasn't acceptable.

Laugh at my old code: https://github.com/JochemvanHout/living-poster-old

## What is the living poster?

Simply put, it's a little project which shows you pictures from reddit on your given topic, presented as a nice looking poster. It rotates to a new picture every few seconds.
Currently it only supports images, so no video's unfortunately.
